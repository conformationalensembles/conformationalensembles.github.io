**Papers**

We will be selecting three speakers from submitted papers. There is no page minimum or limit, but papers must have an abstract, introduction, results (including at least one figure), and conclusions. We encourage submissions of works in progress. We will also accept recently posted preprints. All code, model, and/or machine-learning weights associated with the paper must be open-access by the meeting date and accessible to reviewers by the due date. 

Submit your paper (PDF or link to preprint) via email to conferences@wankowiczlab.com. 

Due Date: 5/15/2025
