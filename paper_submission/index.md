**Papers**

This year, we will also select three speakers from the submitted papers. There is no page minimum or limit, but papers must have an abstract, introduction, results, and conclusions. We encourage submissions of works in progress and will also accept recently posted preprints. All code, models, and/or machine-learning weights associated with the paper must be open-access by the due date.

Submit your paper (PDF or link to preprint) via email to conferences@wankowiczlab.com. 

Due Date: 5/20/2025
