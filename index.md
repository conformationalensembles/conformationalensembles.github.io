<br>
The next frontier of structural biology is bridging functional states and scales to understand how conformational and compositional dynamics impact molecular functions. Despite great progress in experimental and computational approaches, many pivotal questions linger. These include exploring dynamics in transient biology events, the mechanisms underpinning long-range structural interactions within proteins, the alterations in the protein conformational landscape triggered by binding events or the formation of complexes, and, crucially, the implications of these processes for in vivo observations. We will convene a multidisciplinary assembly of experts to exchange innovative experimental and computational strategies to enable insights about structural dynamics across scales, from atomistic to cellular modeling. This meeting is hosted by Altos Labs and the Quantitative Biology Sciences Institute.
